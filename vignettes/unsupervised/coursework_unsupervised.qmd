## Your task

This analysis investigates if local authorities in Great Britain can be classified based on the sorts of traffic collisions that occur in their region.  The purpose is to uncover trends in collision characteristics and groupings of authority with similar road-safety profiles, rather than to anticipate them.

Cluster analysis is useful here because it:

- reduces a large multivariate dataset into a small number of meaningful groups,
- helps us understand which authorities face similar road-safety challenges,
- provides a basis for targeted policy interventions,
- reveals structure that may not be visible in raw data.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used throughout to help visualise these high-dimensional patterns in two dimensions, allowing us to interpret the clustering more easily.

## The Problem

The "Stats19" dataset includes police-reported traffic incidents in Great Britain.  It is composed of three connected tables:

-**Accidents**- Location, road conditions, weather, illumination, and other factors can all contribute to an accident.

-**Vehicles**- Vehicle types, manoeuvres, and driver characteristics.

-**Casualties** — Severity, age, and kind.

 For this study, data is grouped by local authority.  Each authority has the following number of accidents:

-At miniature roundabouts,

-In the rain.

-In the dark,

-On dry roads

-In urban regions,

-The most serious injuries were minor ones. 

These counts are transformed to proportions and rescaled such that all variables contribute equally to grouping. The goal is to see if local governments form natural groupings based on these collision features.

## The Data

A simple scatterplot of the raw proportions gives a first impression of the data:

### Scatter-matrix interpretation

There are several distinct patterns that stand out:

- The majority of incidents in the UK involve minor injuries, as evidenced by the high positive    correlation between n_slight and n_total.
- Dry-road crashes predominate in the dataset, as evidenced by the extremely high shares of n_dry (0.6–0.9) in the majority of authority.
- There are a lot of urban collisions in some jurisdictions and a lot of rural collisions in others.
- The moderate variability of n_raining and n_dark contributes to their separation in subsequent clustering.
- Mini-roundabout collisions (**n_mini**) are uncommon in most regions and only serve as a distinguishing characteristic in some clusters.

These distinctions aid in the explanation of why PCA and clustering subsequently divide authorities according to environmental, lighting, and meteorological patterns.

## Hierarchical clustering

Hierarchical clustering constructs a tree (dendrogram), showing how local authorities can be grouped step-by-step according to similarity in their collision profiles.

### Choosing a cut-point

The height of the branches reflects the dissimilarity between groups. A suitable cut-point is one that:

- avoids many tiny clusters,
- respects major jumps in the dendrogram height,
- reflects meaningful structural differences.

Cutting too low gives dozens of tiny clusters; cutting too high gives one or two oversized clusters with no interpretive value. A mid-level cut is typically appropriate, often producing around 3–5 clusters depending on the data.

### Visualising hierarchical clusters with PCA

To analyse the clusters, we divide the high-dimensional data into two primary components.  PCA identifies the directions of highest variance in the dataset, allowing us to visualise the structure using a simple 2-D graphic.

### Interpretation

The PCA plot clearly reveals **four unique clusters**:

- **Cluster 0 (blue)** — a dense group in the middle that represents typical authorities with balanced collision patterns.  
- **Cluster 1 (red)** is somewhat divided along PC2, indicating locations with more dark or wet collisions.  

- **Cluster 3 (green)** — clearly split to the right (high PC1), indicating authorities involved in a mix of urban and dry-road collisions.  
- **Cluster 2 (purple)** is distributed to the left, showing rural or low-volume authorities with different weather/lighting patterns.

 PCA shows that:

- **PC1 captures variations between dry/urban versus wet/dark profiles**.
- **PC2 reflects severity and illumination differences**, making it a suitable place for visualising clusters.

## k-means clustering

We then use **k-means clustering**, which divides the authorities into *k* groups while reducing within-cluster variance.  Unlike hierarchical clustering, k-means needs a predetermined number of groups.

### Choosing the number of clusters

A value of **k = 4** was selected, backed by:

 - Hierarchical findings with obvious structure in the PCA plot.

 - Interpretability of the obtained centroids.

### Cluster centroids

The centroids of each cluster give the average profile of authorities in that group.

![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kcentroids2.html){width="100%" height="600px"}

### Interpretation

Typical results consist of:

-**Cluster 3** when compared to the clusters displays **very high n_urban** which is typical of cities and urban areas. 
-All the clusters that are shown exhibit **low n_dark and n_raining**, which is typical of authorities in rural or coastal areas with challenging weather.  
-All clusters are similar,when they display **very high proportions of dry-road collisions**. This means that they are in warmer or less rainy areas.  
-All clusters have a **lower or negligible mini-roundabout proportions**.

For every cluster, these centroid discrepancies offer significant storylines.


### Visualising k-means clusters with PCA

As before, PCA allows us to display the clusters in two dimensions:

![](../../data_cache/vignettes/unsupervised_classification/kscatter.html){width="100%" height="600px"}

### Interpretation

The k-means clusters show up:

-**less overlapping**,
-**more compact**,
-**more clearly separated along PC1**

This is indicating that the kmeans captures strong structural variations in collision patterns.

## Why PCA is essential for this analysis

PCA is important because:

 - It divides the 6-dimensional dataset into two axes, capturing the most of the variance.  
 - It indicates which characteristic combinations cause the separation of authority.  

 - It gives a visual assessment to determine whether clusters are meaningful or fake.  
 - It clearly demonstrates that particular authorities have very different weather, illumination, and environment-related crash characteristics.

 Without PCA, clustering would be difficult to comprehend and convey graphically.
